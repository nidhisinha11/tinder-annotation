Abstract: Although online dating platforms are increasing in impact on the current dating scene, there is no existing corpus which focuses on this type of online communication. This paper will describe how we created an annotated dataset for online dating conversations sourced from popular Reddit page r/Tinder, and our peers in order to allow for efficient sentiment analysis on the conversation. Each line in the conversation is tagged with dialogue acts from Stolcke et. al., as well as our own tags specialized for the nature of the corpus. We then tagged each line based on positivity and optional humour, sexual, and other tags in order to accurately describe sentiment and the overall outcome of each exchange.
